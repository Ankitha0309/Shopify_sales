  SQL Description Summary**
Duplicate Records: SQL can identify duplicate rows by grouping data on specific columns and counting occurrences. This helps find repeated entries in your dataset.

Deletion: You can remove unwanted or duplicate records from tables using DELETE statements, often combined with filtering or ranking functions to preserve one copy.
Merging Data: Merging (or upserting) allows combining data from different sources by updating existing records and inserting new ones in a single operation.
Adding Columns: You can modify the table structure by adding new columns to store additional information without affecting existing data.
Adding Rows: New data entries can be inserted into tables with the INSERT statement.
Total Rows Count: COUNT aggregates the total number of rows or grouped entries in a table.
Summation: SUM calculates the total of numeric values in a specific column, useful for aggregating sales or quantities.
Other Aggregations: SQL also supports AVG (average), MAX (maximum), and MIN (minimum) functions to summarize data insights efficiently.
